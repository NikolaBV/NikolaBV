## About Me 🚀
I'm an all-around software engineer with a passion for various fields of computer science. 🌐 Currently, my focus is on mastering full-stack web development through the .NET Core framework, Javascript, C# ect. 

> As the saying goes: "One thing is certain, whatever can be built using JavaScript, will be built using JavaScript." 🤖 (Electron, could you please make it more straightforward for processes to communicate with each other? Thanks) 🌐

I work as a junior software enginer at ConsultCommerce in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. I work mostly on the front-end using the .Net Core framework, C# and Javascript.
