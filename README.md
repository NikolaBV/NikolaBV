Hi, I'm NikolaBV (Koko for short)
I am interested in programming, graphic design, data structures and algorithms (even though I suck at them), full stack development, cybersecurity and much more.
I am currently studying at PG Zaimov Highschool with a degree in programming. I am a beginner but very eager to learn and understand the world of computer science.
Here I will be uploading all my projects with the intent to improve my programming skills and show my progress to the world.
